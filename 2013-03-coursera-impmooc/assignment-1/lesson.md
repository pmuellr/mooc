Record an acoustic/electric ukulele into Ableton Live
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm [Patrick Mueller](http://muellerware.org) from Raleigh, North Carolina.
This lesson is for week 1 of 
[Introduction To Music Production](https://class.coursera.org/musicproduction-001/human_grading/view/courses/970263/assessments/4/submissions) 
at [Coursera](http://coursera.org). 
I will teach you how to record an acoustic/electric ukulele into Ableton Live.
This is really no different than recording an electric or acoustic/electric 
guitar into Ableton Live, but a little sillier and so more fun.

Equipment used for this lesson:

* [Lanikai LU-21TE/BK](http://lanikaiukes.com/laniblog/ukuleles/discontinued/lu-21tebk-tenor-size-ae-black-ukulele/) acoustic/electic ukulele
* Standard electric guitar cable aka TS cable aka instrument cable
* Line 6 Toneport guitar to USB interface box (see [below](#about-toneport) for more info)
* Standard USB cable
* [Ableton Live 9](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/)
* MacBook Pro

To get started, let's hook all the cables up.

1. Plug the electric guitar cable into your ukulele.
2. Plug the other end of the guitar cable into the USB interface box.
3. Plug the USB cable into the USB interface box.
4. Plug the other end of the USB cable into your computer.

There you go, the signal from the ukulele can now make it all the way into your
computer.

Trouble-Shooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Are the batteries in your ukulele working?  Try some new ones.

* Does your USB interface box need power?  Many don't - they can get power
  from the USB cable.  But some do, and will need to be plugged into the
  wall.

* Are all the cables fully plugged into the jacks?

* Ableton.  What can you say, but that "It's complicated".  Luckily, there's
  lots of help available at the Ableton site, including:

    * [questions and answers specifically about guitar](https://www.ableton.com/answers/tags/guitar)
    * [articles describing how to get started](https://www.ableton.com/en/articles/tags/getting-started/)
    * [movies showing you how to get started](https://www.ableton.com/en/help/learn-live/#getting-started)

About the Line 6 TonePort
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To connect my ukulele to my computer, I used a Line 6 Toneport interface.  With
this interface, you plug one end of a standard electric guitar cable into the
interface, and also plug a USB cable into the interface.  In the case of the
Toneport, it takes a USB Type-B plug, which is typical for USB audio devices.
Make sure you get the right USB cable!  Your computer likely uses a Type-A
plug, so you'll need a cable with Type-A on one end, and Type-B on the other.
See this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Cable_plugs_.28USB_1.x.2F2.0.29)
and pictures for more information.

There are a lot of devices available that can get signal from a guitar into a 
computer.  There
best way to see what's available, is to go to your favorite online musical
instrument store, and look around.  For instance, 
[Musician's Friend](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/audio-interfaces/usb) has
a page with just USB-capable audio interfaces, many of which will be appropriate
for using with a guitar or ukulele.  If you're unsure, make sure the description
of the interface says it supports guitar.  If it supports guitar, it will work
with ukulele's as well.  You might also want to download the manual from the
manufacturer's web site to get more information about the interface.
