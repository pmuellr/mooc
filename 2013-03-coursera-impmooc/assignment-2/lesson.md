Record and quantize MIDI from a ukulele with Ableton Live
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm [Patrick Mueller](http://muellerware.org) from Raleigh, North Carolina.
This lesson is an assignment for week 2 of 
[Introduction To Music Production](https://class.coursera.org/musicproduction-001/class/index) 
at [Coursera](http://coursera.org). 
I will teach you how to record and quantize MIDI from an acoustic/electric 
ukulele into Ableton Live.
This is really no different than recording a MIDI keyboard
into Ableton Live, but a little sillier and so more fun, and requires some
way of converting a ukulele analog signal into MIDI.

Equipment used for this lesson:

* [Lanikai LU-21TE/BK](http://lanikaiukes.com/laniblog/ukuleles/discontinued/lu-21tebk-tenor-size-ae-black-ukulele/) acoustic/electic ukulele
* Standard electric guitar cable aka TS cable aka instrument cable
* [Sonuus G2M Universal Guitar to MIDI Converter](http://www.sonuus.com/products_g2m.html)
* [M-Audio Uno USB MIDI cable](http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Uno.html)
* MacBook Pro
* [Ableton Live 9](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/)

The set up is relatively obvious and easy.  Hook up goes:

* uke
* guitar cable
* Sonuus G2M
* M-Audio UNO cable
* MacBook pro

Time to start Live.  We need to set the TonePort as the audio input device.
Do that from the Preferences Panel, in the Audio section.  On that page, there's a
drop-down list labelled Audio Input Device.  The TonePort is listed here, so
select it.  The Preferences Panel will then look like this:

Now we're ready to play with the Live user interface.  I like to work in 
Arrangement View (compared to Session View) and like most of the panels hidden.

To hide panels, you can click the arrow buttons pointed to by the red arrows
on the top left and the two red arrows on the bottom.  To switch between 
Arrangement and Session Views,
use the buttons pointed to by the red arrow on the top right.
